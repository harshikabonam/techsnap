            Many languages came and disappear but JavaScript is one of those few renowned 
            languages that is enjoying a high run and demand in the programming world. In 
            the TIOBE ranking report, JavaScript has been ranked under the top 10 programming
             languages for several years consistently. In fact, the Stack Overflow survey 
             depicts that JavaScript is the most popular language among developers.
              At Octoverse also, JavaScript is enjoying the top position among all 
              programming languages. Meanwhile, some of the renowned companies in the tech
               world that are using JavaScript are <b><u>Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber,</u></b>  etc.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="text textcol col-8">
            Though the language is primarily known for adding responsive 
            elements on web pages it has a wide range of applications such as in web development, game
             development, mobile application development, and many more. Moreover, the language is being
             sed for both – Front End Development and Back End Development. Also, its compatibility with
              some prominent frameworks like React, Vue, Node, etc. makes it more preferable among the
               developers. As there are millions of websites already existing over the web that are
                heavily relying on JavaScript and on top of that, looking at the demand & dominance 
                of the language, it won’t be wrong to say that JavaScript will rule in 2021 as well!</div>

            If we particularly talk about C language, the general-purpose procedural programming language is majorly used in the development of low-level systems like operating systems, kernel development, and others. And many other programming languages inherit the properties of this particular language. On the other hand, C++ is an object-oriented programming language (primarily developed as an extension of C). The language is widely used in Game Development, GUI & Desktop applications, and Competitive Programming along with several other fields.
